DIAGNOZ

INTRO
OUR MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TAKES IN AUDIO AS INPUT FILE, THEN PROCESSES IT TO GENRATE A REPORT GIVING THE DISEASE APPROXIMATION AND ITS TREATMENT.

WORKING
The platform uses google cloud speech to text api to transcribe doctor patient conversation in real time. The generated text input is then passed to our machine learning model to predict the disease and the treatment guides the patient is suffering from and helps the doctor to keep a medical record of the patient as well as guide him on a treatment protocol taking into account the details of the patient from all the previous meeting with the doctor. The proposed mobile application interface will also allow the doctor to edit the ml prediction wherever he seems fit.
